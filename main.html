            <h2>Why is Paris called the City of Love?</h2>
            <p>Paris is called the "City of Love" because its romantic atmosphere, artistic culture, aesthetic beauty, and popular
            landmarks like the Eiffel Tower have made it a dream destination for lovers, honeymooners, and artists for centuries.
            The city's charm, highlighted in literature and film, and the French culture's embrace of romantic expression,
            contribute to this nickname, which became more formalized around the time of the ICCA's city branding efforts in the
            20th century.</p>
